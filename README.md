# About

#### pyntree is a python package which allows you to easily and syntactically save your data. Not only that, it also lets you save in multiple formats, and even serialize and compress data by merely changing a few characters.

## Installing
`pip install pyntree`

## Example usage
```python
from pyntree import Node
db = Node("your_new_db.pyn")
db.hello = "world"
db.hello()
# Output: "world"
db.save()
```
#### 1-liner for saving existing data
```python
from datetime import datetime as dt
from pyntree import Node
data = {'right_now': dt.now()}  # Some sample data
Node(data).save('file.pyn')  # 1-liner to save your data to a file!
```

## Features
pyntree is capable of handling the following files, functions, and formats:
- Dictionaries in plain text
- Pickled files/serialization
- JSON & YAML files
- Encryption
- Backwards compatibility with files saved by pyndb (except encrypted files)
- Compression in many popular formats
- Autosaving & saving on close (when garbage collected)
- ...and more!
